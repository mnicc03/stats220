# My Stats220 repository

## Summary

Hey there! My name is Max Nicholson and this is my **Stats220 Github repository!** The purpose of this repository is to show off the collection of my present and future work for my Stats220 course, and hopefully have a lot of fun along the way with coding!

A few *fun* facts about me are...

* I love field hockey 
* Studies Psychology and Geographic information science at the University of Auckland
* Passionate about staying healthy through gymmming and regular outdoor adventures!

What I wish to achieve within this course...

1. Expand my coding knowledge 
2. Interlink my GISCI understanding of coding with my Stats220 coding 
3. Push myself to learn as much as I can to use later in my life 

Here is a link to my current Github website! (https://mnicc03.github.io/stats220/)
